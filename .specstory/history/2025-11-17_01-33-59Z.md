_**Agent (glm-4.6) (sidechain)**_

I'll help you warm up and explore this codebase. Let me start by understanding the structure of the project.

<function=exec>
<parameter=tool>Bash</parameter>
<parameter=command>ls -la /home/edann/vscode_projects/social-video-explorer/</parameter>
</function>

_**Agent (glm-4.5-air) (sidechain)**_

I'll help you warm up by exploring the codebase structure. Let me start by understanding the project layout and key files.

<Read path="/home/edann/vscode_projects/social-video-explorer/CLAUDE.md" />

Let me check the overall project structure:

<Read path="/home/edann/vscode_projects/social-video-explorer" />

Let me look for the OpenSpec configuration file mentioned in the instructions:

<Read path="/home/edann/vscode_projects/social-video-explorer/openspec/AGENTS.md" />

Let me also check if there are any package.json or other configuration files to understand the project type:

<Glob pattern="package.json" />

<Glob pattern="*.md" />

Now let me get a sense of the main source code structure:

<Glob pattern="src/**/*.ts" />
<Glob pattern="src/**/*.js" />
<Glob pattern="src/**/*.tsx" />
<Glob pattern="src/**/*.jsx" />

Let me also check for test files:

<Glob pattern="**/*.test.*" />
<Glob pattern="**/*.spec.*" />

Based on this exploration, I can see this is a project with TypeScript/JavaScript source code, markdown documentation, and likely follows a modern web application structure. The presence of openspec suggests this project uses OpenSpec for change management and agent guidance.
